# Improvements for future
 

<ul>
<li>Refactoring the code: A better usage in the future will be to useContext or redux. There was a lot of props drilling.</li>
<li>Inline styling: We used some inline styling rather than having it in a CSS file. An improvement will be to use styled components for cleaner more fluid code</li>
<li>Creating a more dynamic friend request system that requires acceptance</li>
